# MainProject - School Time Table Management System
# Purpose
The Time Table Management System is basically updating a convenient and easy to use weekly time table where each student and teacher can access their time table schedule by using an internet-based application so that the users can have a particular time table in every week. Since we should keep social distance with everyone until the threat goes away, every school can start their work by respecting health rules and regulations with a minimum number of students and teachers.
